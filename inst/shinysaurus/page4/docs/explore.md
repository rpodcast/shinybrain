# Shinysaurus

Use this interface to visualize each of the included data sets straight from the [{datasauRus}](https://itsalocke.com/datasaurus) package! Once you select a data set in the **Explore** interface, take advantage of the interactive scatterplot to brush-select certain points and see the real-time updates to summary statistics.

Then, for some added fun, visit the **Animate** interface to select a starting and ending data set and create an animated scatterplot powered by the [`{metamers}`](https://github.com/eliocamp/metamer) package authored by [Elio Campitelli](https://github.com/eliocamp).
